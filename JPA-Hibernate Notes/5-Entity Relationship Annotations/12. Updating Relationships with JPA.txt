How relationships affect update and delete?

Let's create update jpa starter class.

//Updating an employee2 to subscribe to another emailGroup.
//employee2 decides to join Python group so, it should get email from python.

public class JpaStarterUpdate {

	//EntityManagerFactory
	//EntityManager

	//fetching data of employee and that python email group
	Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, 2);
        EmailGroup emailGroup = entityManager.find(EmailGroup.class,8);

        //updating
	employee.addEmailSubscription(emailGroup);
        emailGroup.addEmployee(employee);

	//EntityTransaction, .begin,.commit

	entityManager.persist(employee);
        entityManager.persist(emailGroup);

}

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, the table will be updated and employee 2 will be also added to emailGroup 8.
