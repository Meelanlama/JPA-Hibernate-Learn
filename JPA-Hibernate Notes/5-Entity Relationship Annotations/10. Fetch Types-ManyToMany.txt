How we fetch data of ManyToMany relationship?

//Reading:

 	EmailGroup emailGroup = entityManager.find(EmailGroup.class, 7);
        System.out.println("*** GOT EMAIL GROUP, Now accessing employee list");
        System.out.println(emailGroup.getEmployeeList());

//PRINTS the data of employee that emailGroup of id = 7 is related to..

// This @ManyToMany is also "Lazy Type". As it'll only access the data when it's needed/called.

-- Code explain:

When getting emailGroup only: it'll select the EmailGroup table only at first.

Hibernate: 
    select
        emailgroup0_.id as id1_1_0_,
        emailgroup0_.groupName as groupnam2_1_0_ 
    from
        EmailGroup emailgroup0_ 
    where
        emailgroup0_.id=?
*** GOT EMAIL GROUP, Now accessing employee list

Now, we are acessing data of employee from emailGroup instance. So Only now it'll call that Employee Table when it's accessed.
This is "LAZY fetch type" by default.

But, when it's "Eager type". When accessing emailGroup Table. The employee table will also be accessed without calling. 

--- Be very careful when fetching ManyToMany. So "Lazy" fetch type is preferred.

--Reason: @ManyToMany relationships can fetch a large number of records, leading to performance issues. Lazy fetching (FetchType.LAZY) is preferred to avoid unnecessary data loading and improve efficiency.
