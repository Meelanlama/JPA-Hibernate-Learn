  	String minAge = "25;DROP Table Employee_TABLE";
       TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery(
                "select e from Employee e where e.age > " + minAge,
                Employee.class);


What this query does is, When the first query is finished. It'll run the second query like this.
So, appending String is a bad idea. 
We need to make sure there's only one query run and they don't do mischiefs like this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SO, JPQL HAS CONCEPT CALLED PARAMATER.

CODE:
		 String minAge = "25;DROP Table Employee_TABLE";

                "select e from Employee e where e.age > :minAge",
       
		query.setParameter("minAge", minAge);


Now, when paramater is set it knows that your intent is to run a single query only. So, setting the second query like DROP won't run as it detects the attached query.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

That minAge type should int. But this is for demo purpose.

When you're dealing with the variables. Always makesure use parameters for it.
