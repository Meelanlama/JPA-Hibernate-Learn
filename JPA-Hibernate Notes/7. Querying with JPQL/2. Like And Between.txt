If you know firstname of the employee is "Java" but don't know last name.

--- Like

TypedQuery<Employee> query = entityManager.createQuery(
    "SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.name LIKE 'Java%'",
    Employee.class
);

//Will prints: JAVA BRAINS.

---- BETWEEN

"select e from Employee e where e.age BETWEEN 20 and 25"
