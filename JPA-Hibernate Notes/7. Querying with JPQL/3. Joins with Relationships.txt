You can combine data from two tables.

Now, you need query: Employee who have valid accesscard. So, we need to combine data of access_card and employee_data

Example:

SELECT e.* FROM EMPLOYEE_DATA e
JOIN ACCESS_CARD a
ON e.ACCESSCARD_ID = a.id
AND a.isactive = true;

Here, we'll only get employee data who have valid access card in SQL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IN JPQL, THERE'S MANY POSSIBILITES BECAUSE THE JOIN IS ALREADY DONE IN JAVA SIDE.

FOR SUCH JOIN CASES: JPQL IS WAY BETTER THAN SQL:

-- EXAMPLE:

 "select e from Employee e where e.accessCard.isActive = true ",

It's gonna print the same result where prints employees whose card is valid.
This query does the same as JOIN in above SQL query.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You don't have to do JOIN in lot of situations in JPQL.

If you wanna do the JOIN then:

"select e from Employee e JOIN AccessCard a ON e.id = a.id";
