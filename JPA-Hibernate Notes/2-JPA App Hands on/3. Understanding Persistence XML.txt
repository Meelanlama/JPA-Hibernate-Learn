- Created a persistence context in xml
- Created an entity and mapped it to the database using JPA annotations

Let's look at individual properties in xml file. Meta data about the connection and behaviour.

# Persistence XML contains the configuration like:
- Database connection string
- Username and password
- SQL related options
- Transaction related options
- Provider configuration - like "automatic" behaviour

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- It start's with Persistence Unit: It contains meta data about persistence context

    <persistence-unit name="myApp" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">

We create EntityManagerFactory from this persistence unit. We Use this persistence unit while creating EntityManagerFactory.

And, From EntityManagerFactory we create EntityManager which is responsible for creating and managing entities.

Another transaction-type is JTA.Which helps in multiple datbases.

- <provider>org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider</provider>

This is the Implementation of JPA also referred to as Instance Provider

- Next, we have this <properties> node which allows to configure how hibernate behaves: like providing : database url,driver,user,password

- Inside <properties> we are also configuring hibernate:
  
// tells to show sql queries in console. If false then sql queries won't show.
<property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/>                                  

//going to format sql queries that shows in console
<property name="hibernate.format_sql" value="true"/>

The above two are for development purpose.

// A dialact is a sql grammar that JPA uses to connect to database. There's a small difference in sql queries format for different databases(Like MYSQL,POSTGRES,H2). So use the (H2) dialact for the database we are connecting/using.
<property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect"/>

//Telling what automatic behaviour we want hibernate to have while converting from hibernate entitiy annotation to DDL(Data definition language).Want update only table or creating and dropping table.
<property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="create-drop"/>
